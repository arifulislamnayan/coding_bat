Here is some intersting python  programming problems for practice.  
Problem no.2


We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters a_smile and b_smile indicate if each is smiling. We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return True if we are in trouble.</br>

monkey_trouble(True, True) → True </br>
monkey_trouble(False, False) → True </br>
monkey_trouble(True, False) → False </br>
